# Introduction

This project is a web application based on react flow (A highly customizable React component for building node-based editors and interactive diagrams).

This project is using Next.js, React.js, Typescript, Tremor and Tailwind.

Despite it is not recommended for clean code, I added few comments in the code to improve the comprenhension for beginners.

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies with

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Utilisation

In the home page, you can add your own _JSON_ file or start with an exemple and modify it after. (Excel isn't available for the moment).
You can also download the file in two formats : _JSON_ or _Excel (xlsx)_.
You can see at top right a boutton to see all keyboard shortcuts.

---

You can add different types of nodes by clicking on "add node".
If you click on the black circle on each group/node bottom you can create edges between them.
